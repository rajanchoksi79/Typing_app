        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Effective Date: 30/12/2024 <br><br>

            Thank you for using our Typing Practice App ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are
            committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy outlines the
            information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your privacy while using our app.
            <br><br>

            1. Information We Collect <br>

            Our Typing Practice App does not collect any personal information such as names, email addresses, or any
            other identifiable data. The app operates solely on data stored locally within the app and does not require
            backend server to function. <br><br>

            2. Use of Information <br>

            The app generates typing practice paragraphs randomly from a file stored within the app. We do not store any
            user input, nor do we track or collect typing data such as words typed, typing speed (WPM), or accuracy in a
            manner that could identify individual users. <br>

            The only information processed during use is: <br>

            - The typed input that is temporarily used to check accuracy and calculate words per minute (WPM).
            - Typing practice content sourced from a pre-existing file, which is randomly selected for each user
            session. <br>

            This data is processed solely for the purpose of providing typing practice and real-time feedback within the
            app. <br><br>

            3. Data Storage <br>

            No personal data is stored on our servers, nor do we collect or store any typing history. The content
            displayed in the app (typing paragraphs) is fetched from a local file included with the app, and no data is
            shared or transmitted beyond the local app environment. <br><br>

            4. Third-Party Services <br>

            Our Typing Practice App does not include third-party analytics, advertising, or other third-party services
            that would collect personal information or use tracking mechanisms. We do not share or sell any data to
            third parties. <br><br>

            5. Security <br>

            Since the app does not collect sensitive personal information and operates offline, we have not implemented
            additional security measures for data protection. However, we recommend that you keep your device secure to
            prevent unauthorized access. <br><br>

            6. Updates to Privacy Policy <br>

            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted within the app.
            <br><br>
